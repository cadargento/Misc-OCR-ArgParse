This was an intro to OCR and ArgParse.

The files Screensot_XX.png are fortnite health screenshots.  To implement in-game, find pixel coordinates on screen and pyscreenshot the area.

The file img.png is an example of the format of my local date/time (the bbox="..." coordinates in the code are the local coordinates).

I looked into ArgParse for replacing a Redfish automator's self-created argument parser.

The OCR was used to tell the date and time, and to be able to read the health on a fortnite healthbar.

Potential Improvements:  Write a script to monitor health in Minecraft or Darksouls (Darksouls doesn't have a visible number for health).

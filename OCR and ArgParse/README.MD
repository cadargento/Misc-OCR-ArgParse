This was an intro to OCR and ArgParse.

I looked into ArgParse for replacing a Redfish automator's self-created argument parser.

The OCR was used to tell the date and time, and to be able to read the health on a fortnite healthbar.

Potential Improvements:  Write a script to monitor health in Minecraft or Darksouls (Darksouls doesn't have a visible number for health).
